      <description>As an app designer, you have the opportunity to deliver an extraordinary product that rises to the top of the App Store charts. To do so, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to meet high expectations for quality and functionality.
Three primary themes differentiate iOS from other platforms:
Clarity[清晰]. Throughout the system, text is legible[清晰的] at every size, icons are precise and lucid, adornments[装点] are subtle[巧妙] and appropriate, and a sharpened focus[锋利聚焦] on functionality motivates the design.</description>

      <description>Most iOS apps are built using components from UIKit, a programming framework that defines common interface elements. This framework lets apps achieve a consistent appearance across the system, while at the same time offering a high level of customization. UIKit elements are flexible and familiar. They’re adaptable, enabling you to design a single app that looks great on any iOS device, and they automatically update when the system introduces appearance changes.</description>
